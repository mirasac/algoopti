## Introduction
This repository contains source code and material (e.g. notes) about problems faced during the course [Algorithms for optimization, inference and learning](https://fisica-sc.campusnet.unito.it/do/corsi.pl/Show?_id=a763), taken during the second semester of the academic year 2022-2023 for the master's degree in Physics of Complex Systems at UniTo.

The regular teacher of this course is Professor Braunstein. The course and [its official web site](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01SPOPF&p_a_acc=2223&p_header=S&p_lang=EN) are hosted at Politecnico di Torino.

### Disclaimer
This repository exists just as an effective way to save the code while the exercises are being done, it is not meant for presenting them in a complete and nice way. Just the information sufficient for the resolution of problems are included.

## Repository structure
Files related to a problem are contained in a directory with name `Problem_n` where n is the number of the problem at the time of the creation of the directory. This numbering come from the problems list on professor's LaTeX notes, so it could go out of sync with the real numbering on the notes at any time. To provide consistency, the following list associates numbers to problems permanently and it is updated each time a new problem is inserted in the repository:

- 3 Sierpinskiâ€™s triangle
- 35 Making a difference

## Programming environment
During lesson code is written in Julia, but in this repository both Python and Julia codes are present (since I am new to Julia language).

My local environment is VS Code as visual text editor. In case I use Julia, I choose version 1.6.7 since it is the [LTS release](https://julialang.org/downloads/#long_term_support_release).

To be more flexible, I plan to use Julia in Google Colab. Some information [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58270424/julia-in-google-colab) and [here](https://github.com/Dsantra92/Julia-on-Colab). [Another reference](https://github.com/johnnychen94/colab-julia-bootstrap), explained better.

A possible road map could be the following:
1. create Jupyter notebook with some Julia code and save it on GitHub;
2. test the notebook in Binder (cfr. [tutorial on the official site](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html)), to check that it works, is available on the Internet and as a fallback plan if Google Colab does not work [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mirasac/algoopti.git/test-julia);
3. install Julia on the fly on a Google Colab session, cfr. references;
4. check if the Julia environment on Google Colab works, test it also by loading the Jupyter notebook prepared at point 1;
5. create a Jupyter notebook to automate the installation at the start of each session, cfr. references.

Log:
- 20230318T1405 I am trying to put all the needed files in a subfolder of the repository, as opposed to what suggested in the tutorial. Moreover I am doing these tests in a branch which is not `main`, but I hope that the branch name makes no difference on Binder's internal working.
- T1416 Binder allows to specify the branch (more generally, the reference in the repository history) and the path where the notebook should be loaded from.
- T1600 JL files are working in Binder, Jupyter notebook with Julia code inserted in the repository to proceed with point 1.
- T1730 I discovered it is possible to pull files from GitHub to make them available in Binder after the session is started, without starting a new Binder session.
- T1740 Loading the repo and using Julia files and notebook in Binder is feasible. The opposite operation, i.e. saving the changes done in Binder to Git, is more convoluted since it is necessary to download them locally first (to avoid privacy and security issues in a direct connection through Git).
- T2358 In case of fallback to Binder, variable `JULIA_VERSION`in the notebooks must have the same value of key `julia` in section `[comp]` of file `Project.toml`.
- 20230320T0049 After comparing the notebooks provided by the sources I found plus the ones I create inside VS Code and Google Colab, I have found the minimum requirements to make Google Colab recognize the notebook as a Julia notebook.
- T0107 Since for the course I do not need it, GPU support is not present in the template. Refer to the sources if it is needed.
- T0221 Points 3, 4 and 5 are completed. The only difference with what I planned is in point 4 because I did not know that a specific notebook structure is needed to work with Julia in Google Colab. This is not a problem, since I needed to adapt the notebook metadata, following the template.
- T0235 Test on Google Colab: load notebook from GitHub, install Julia, execute something in Julia, save changes to GitHub with the built-in functionality of Google Colab. Everything worked as expected, I am ready to use it for real purposes (and that is when the real testing begins).
- T0238 Made a final commit, but before merging the branch I want to organize the notes in this README.
- 20230320T2126 To create a new notebook: open Google Colab, File -> Open notebook -> select the option to connect to GitHub -> choose the template notebook -> as soon as it loads, save it in GitHub and change name or path. To edit an existing notebook: open Google Colab, File -> Open notebook -> select the option to connect to GitHub -> choose the notebook to edit. Then when it is time to save the changes: File -> Save to GitHub -> kkep the same name and path, specify a commit message for clarity. Changes to the notebooks pushed in this way are not signed, althought they are performed by the correct account (since it is used by Google Colab to conect to GitHub).
- T2150 DO NOT switch back to the Python 3 runtime, otherwise Google Colab changes the metadata of the notebook such that the Julia runtime can not be selected any more, since these metadata are not accessible from the front end. If such problem arises, to avoid losing the changes the notebook should be saved to GitHub anyway, then the metadata related to the language should be reset to the ones present in the template; they can be edited by accessing the raw form of the notebook (which is JSON).
- T2217 Added badge to open template notebook in Colab, but it works only if files exist on the branch for which it is created, so the badge for the template will work only when a file template.ipynb exists in branch `main`. As a general rule it is better to insert badges in the notebooks only when I am sure they will work.
