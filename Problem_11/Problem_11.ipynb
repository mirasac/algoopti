    "The function takes as arguments the number of elements $n$ and the size of the subsets $k$. Clearly the condition $k \\leq n$ must be always verified. This idea can be generalized to operate on a set of generic elements, not necessarily a sequence of natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "First it selects an element from the original set, say the last one to set up a tail recursion. Two cases arise for this elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is part of the subset, then the function is called again passing the original set excluding this element and subset size $k - 1$.\n",
    "2. It is not a part of any subset, then the function is called again passing the original set excluding this element and subset size $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process stops when either the set passed as argument is empty, meaning that all the possible combinations of elements are explored, or subset size $k = 0$, meaning that all the subsets of $k$ elements are explored."
